These are tests for proper differences as computed by ort-diff(1).

Each test consists of three files: the old file, the new file, and the
differences between them.  These are suffixed `.old.ort`, `.new.ort`,
and `.result`, respectively.

If the format changes for ort-diff(1), all of the `.result` files should
be regenerated.
