.Sh NAME
.Nm kwebapp
.Nd syntax for kwebapp configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration is used by
.Xr kwebapp 1
to generate C source and header files that drive a database.
It is a free-form (white-space is not significant beyond separating
tokens) configuration language with the following rough structure:
.Bd -literal
[ "struct" structname 
  "{"
    [ fieldname [ type ] ";" ]+
  "}"
]+
.Ed
.Pp
In simple language, one or more structure definitions, each containing
one or more fields.
A
.Dq structure
is a database table or C struct; whereas a
.Dq field
is a column or a struct member.
.Pp
Structure and field names must be alphanumeric strings of at least one
character and starting with a letter.
The optional type may be one of
.Dq txt
or
.Dq text
for a nil-terminated string or
.Dq int
or
.Dq integer
for a 64-bit integer.
By default, fields are integers.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A simple session table is as follows:
.Bd -literal
session { 
  userid;
  token;
  id;
}
